## Final Project (300 points)

**Format**

- Individual project by default; a team of two allowed with instructor approval.  
- Three possible types:  
  1. **Survey paper** on a focused topic (≥ 8 pages, extensive coverage).  
  2. **Original research idea** (≥ 6 pages) with analytical and/or experimental results.  
  3. **Implementation of an existing paper** (≥ 6 pages) with source code and experimental results.

All reports must follow the provided IEEE template and be prepared in **LaTeX**.

**Required sections for the final report**

1. Title and abstract  
2. Introduction (problem statement and background)  
3. Related work (summary of state-of-the-art and related research)  
4. Main technique / methodology  
5. Evaluation (analytical or experimental results; not required for survey-only projects)  
6. Discussion and future directions  
7. Conclusion  
8. References

**Deliverables**

1. **Proposal (30 points)**  
   - 1-page PDF including: problem statement, tentative plan, team members and task allocation (if applicable).  

2. **Mid-stage report (30 points)**  
   - ≥ 3-page PDF with preliminary versions of Sections 1–5.  
   - For surveys, should cover at least half of the targeted literature.  

3. **Final report (180 points)**  
   - PDF in IEEE format, meeting page-length requirements (8+ pages survey; 6+ pages research/implementation).  
   - Include source code if applicable.  

4. **Final presentation (60 points)**  
   - Presentation video of **at least 18 minutes** per project.  
   - All team members must present.  
   - Slides should be detailed yet concise. 

**Grading criteria for final project**

- **Report quality (60 points):** structure, clarity, completeness, and professional writing.  
- **Overall project quality (120 points):** technical depth, originality, and evaluation.

## Academic Integrity & Ethics

All students are bound by the **Stevens Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity**. Work submitted for credit must be entirely your own; all outside assistance must be properly acknowledged. Violations will be handled according to university policy and may result in severe sanctions.  

In addition, this course enforces the following penalties for identical or near-identical submissions:

- **First occurrence:** 50% off both submissions and a warning.  
- **Second occurrence:** 100% off both submissions and a report to the university.  

Assignments may be checked with Turnitin or similar tools for originality.
