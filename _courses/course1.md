This graduate course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practice of information systems security. It covers core security properties (confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and accountability) and the cryptographic primitives used to achieve them, including symmetric and public-key encryption, message authentication codes, digital signatures, and key management.

### Logistics

## Grading Policy

- **Paper Presentations:** 35%  
- **Paper Reports / Summaries:** 25%  
- **Class Participation & Discussion:** 15%  
- **Course Project (proposal, report, presentation):** 25%  

### Letter Grade Cutoffs (Example)

- A range: 90–100%  
- B range: 80–89%  
- C range: 70–79%  
- Below 70%: Unsatisfactory

## Course Project

Students will work individually or in small teams (2–3 members) on a semester-long project related to information systems security. Possible directions include:

- Designing or evaluating a security mechanism or protocol;  
- Implementing and measuring an attack in a controlled environment;  
- Performing an experimental study of a security property in a real system;  
- Conducting a survey and critical analysis of a focused research area.  

The project will include a short **proposal**, a **final written report** (in conference-paper format), and an **in-class presentation**.
