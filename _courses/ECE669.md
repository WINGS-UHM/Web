The goal of this course is to connect wireless and mobile security concepts with a hands-on, system-level demo. Students will work in small teams to build parts of a shared experimental platform and combine them into one working demonstration by mid-semester. In the second half of the semester, the class will use the completed platform to explore and evaluate one security-related question in wireless/mobile systems (e.g., how reliable a measurement is under interference, what happens when information is missing or manipulated, or how simple protections change system behavior). Throughout the semester, teams will give short progress updates and finish with a final demo and brief report that links their technical work back to security goals such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy.
